# Agile

- Theme: Get GiggleGit demo into a stable enough alpha to start onboarding some adventurous clients
- Epic: Onboarding experience
- User story 1: As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to learn GiggleGit commands quickly and intuitively so that I can use them in my daily work without causing disruptions.
- User story 2: As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to have clear guidelines and best practices to streamline my team's workflow.
- User story 3: As a user, I want GiggleGit to manage my merges with memes that are relevant to my age group so that my version control experience feels more personalized and engaging.
    - Task: Implement meme filtering system by age
        - Ticket 1: Enable users to set and update their age group
            - Create a user settings config that stores the user's selected age group
        - Ticket 2: Display age-specific memes
            - Reference user's age settings to retrieve and display memes associated with that age group
